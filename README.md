# Recruitment Bot

This sample bot represents best practices in building intelligent bots using Oracle's Digital Assistant (ODA). Using a "Recruitment" use case, this bot shows how you can use open questions combined with an active listening approach to create an intelligent conversation with the bot user, while extracting as much information as possible to find the best job for the candidate. 

## Getting Started
1. Import the bot archive (located in export folder) in your ODA instance, and train the bot
2. Go to the tester and enter a greeting like "hi"
3. Tap on "Let's get started button"
4. Answer the bot questions

## Folder Structure

- export: contains bot archive that can be imported into an ODA instance 
- bot: contains the unzipped content of the bot archive 
- customcomponents: contains the artefacts for creating custom components used by the bot. See the readme in this directory for details
- web: contains artefacts to deploy the bot as a web page using the Web SDK
